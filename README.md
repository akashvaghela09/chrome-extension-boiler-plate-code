# React Chrome Extension Template

This is a boilerplate project for creating a Chrome extension using the latest technologies such as [manifest version 2](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/manifestVersion/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). It includes all the necessary code and scripts for building and packaging the extension, as well as **hot reloading** during development.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository in your local machine

```
git clone https://github.com/akashvaghela09/react-chrome-extension-template.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd react-chrome-extension-template
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

4. Before starting the server
   - Make sure that you are using node version 16.
   - Check node version using the following command:

        ```
        node -v
        ```

   - If you are using a different node version, then install node version 16 using the following command:

        ```
        nvm install 16
        ```

   - Check this [link](https://techstacker.com/run-multiple-node-versions-node-nvm/) on how to install and use `nvm`, manage multiple node versions, and switch between them.

5. Start the development server:

```
npm start
```

Happy Hacking :)


## Loading the Extension

To load the extension in Chrome, follow these steps:

1. Open Chrome and go to the extensions page `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable developer mode by clicking the toggle in the top right corner.
3. Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the `dev` folder.

The extension should now be loaded in Chrome. You can verify this by looking for the extension's icon in the browser toolbar.

## Scripts

The following scripts are available:

### `npm start`

This script starts the development server and enables hot reloading using webpack. To use it, run:

```
npm start
```

### `npm run build`

This script builds the extension for production. It creates a build folder with the compiled code and assets. To use it, run:

```
npm run build
```

### `npm run zip`

This script creates a ZIP archive of the extension. It includes the manifest.json file, the backgroundScript and contentScript folders, and the files in the build folder. To use it, run:

```
npm run zip
```

### `npm run pack`

This script combines the build and zip scripts into one command. It first builds the extension, then creates a ZIP archive of the result. To use it, run:

```
npm run pack
```

## Feedback and Support

If you have any questions or issues with the extension, please don't hesitate to reach out. You can send me a message through the repository's issues page or via email at <akashvaghela@protonmail.com>.
